Only use the contents of this file for reference. It contains information about our stack and coding guidelines. Refer to this during our session as necessary. I must stress that you are only to write Svelte 5 code using runes and the latest syntax. Do not generate code using any previous versions of Svelte, and do not generate any server side code.

Read this documentation and continually refer to it during the session: https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/svelte-complete-medium
